       ref https://askubuntu.com/questions/22910/what-is-the-difference-between-and-sh-to-run-a-script

       1) 
            sh file        # executing with shell interpreter in a new process
            bash file      # executing with bash interpreter in a new process
            bash file      # executing with bash interpreter in a new process

       2)
            . file        #  executes a shell-script file in the current shell process

       3)   
             ./file       # making executable & run
                            ( chmod a+x file )
                   
                         - it'll detect the interpreter based on hashbang line
                              ( 
                                 hashbang -> first line in script file 
                                 #!/usr/bin/bash
                                 #!/usr/bin/sh
                              )
                          - the script will be paassed to the interpreter in a new process

                            .i.e  
                              if the hashbang is #!/usr/bin/bash  then 
                                   /usr/bin/bash file



========================================

$ cat /etc/shells   -> gives all shell scripts that are available in the system

$ cat /etc/passwd | grep ^userName   --> to print user default shell 

default shell are defined per user in /etc/passwd   file
  eg: for user ravinder
      ravinder:x:1000:1000:ravinder,,,:/home/ravinder:/bin/bash
